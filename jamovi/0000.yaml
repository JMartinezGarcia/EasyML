    description: >
        Perform advanced regression analysis using an automated machine learning workflow.
        This module includes data preprocessing, model training with multiple algorithms
        (Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine),
        hyperparameter tuning, regression metrics and diagnostics, and sensitivity analysis
        (including methods such as SHAP, PFI, Olden, and Sobol). Designed to simplify
        powerful ML techniques for regression while ensuring interpretability and flexibility.

    description: >
        Perform automated multiclass classification with a streamlined machine learning workflow.
        This module covers data preprocessing, model training with several algorithms
        (Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine),
        hyperparameter tuning, multiclass performance metrics and diagnostic tools, and
        comprehensive sensitivity analysis (SHAP, PFI, Olden, and Sobol). Built to combine
        automation, interpretability, and flexibility for multiclass prediction tasks.
